    description: "The 'orders' model is a transformation of the
      'stg_ecommerce__orders' source table and the
      'int_ecommerce_product_order_item' intermediate table. It aggregates order
      item measures at the order level and joins them with the order details.
      The model includes the following columns: 'order_id', 'order_created_at',
      'order_shipped_at', 'order_delivered_at', 'order_returned_at',
      'order_status', 'num_items_ordered', 'total_sale_price',
      'total_product_cost', 'total_profit', and 'total_discount'. The 'order_id'
      column is used as the unique identifier for each order. The
      'total_sale_price', 'total_product_cost', 'total_profit', and
      'total_discount' columns are aggregated from the
      'int_ecommerce_product_order_item' table. The remaining columns are
      sourced from the 'stg_ecommerce__orders' table."
